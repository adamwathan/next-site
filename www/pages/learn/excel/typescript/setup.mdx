    correctAnswer: 'The dev server started and a tsconfig.json file was created for me'
  }
};

## Setup

Let's start by creating a basic project with Next.js:

```bash
mkdir next-ts
cd next-ts
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom next
mkdir pages
```

Now let's add `TypeScript` and important `@types` we'll need:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

Then open the `package.json` file in the `next-ts` directory and add the following npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

You'll also need a page to render, let's create `pages/index.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
const Home = () => <h1>Hello world!</h1>;

export default Home;
```

Now everything is ready. Run the following command to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

What did Next.js show on the terminal output ?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
